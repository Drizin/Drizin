Some non-opensource projects which I built and still maintain:

  Social TV platform (launched in 2012) for users to share what they are watching, see what others are watching, and connect to people who are watching the same TV shows.  
  Itâ€™s based on crawler robots, and has more than **3 million** monthly page views.
- :star: - [Krepost](https://www.abstrakti.com/Products/Krepost) and [Castellum](https://www.abstrakti.com/Products/Castellum) are Migration tools to export source code history from Microsoft Visual SourceSafe to Subversion or Git respectively.
